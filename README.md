# Docu-RAG
I am trying to create a chatbot that uses RAG to give useful answers and the knowledge base is going to be built using  a web scraper that enumerates urls of the specified documentation. (idk how to explain it in any other way, this is a project for my own practice and my knowledge on the topic is very limited)
